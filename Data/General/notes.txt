1. entity authentication requires:
	a. entity identification/identity
	b. freshness / entity is alive

2. for entity authentication :
	a. setup a shared secret key during entity identifiaction ( this provides CONTINOUS entity authentication feature ) or shared zone key is fine.

3. when master pings alive message to all devices , this message includes : 
	a. all authenticaed followers publick keys df
	b. nonce for freshness
	c. data origin auth. wiht digital signature. (ie signed with master pub key)

4. dead master claim requires :
	a. random k*(constant time)s of wait before claim.

5. new master can request public key df , reply with df verifies other followers , message includes:
	a. nonce for freshness :
	b. new master public key signed with zone key.

6. zone key saved as hash on all devices.

https://www.random.org/sequences/?min=10&max=20&col=10&format=plain&rnd=new ... for true random

7. use hsm api to store zone key ... back this up on another HSM

8. archive old private-public key pair ... after key lifetime. needs a detailed key archival system. with device(identifier)-env(info)-keys mapping

9. master will be center of old key archive.

10. block chain will store public key certificates .... coressponding transaction ids controled/stored by master.
	follower add to group transation itself is the public key certificate.

--- path of exile ---

1. on setup input -
	a. master (bool) (essential)
	b. zone key (str) (essential)
	c. if master exist ... master IP address. (optinal)
	d. unique name (essential)
then register directly to bc.
if not master device ping group assositaion transaction id to master IP ... ping every 30s (alive message) ... master reply with aliveList
assume master dead if last aliveList > 5min

2. life loop :
	if master :
		if new goroup create it .
		while(true):
			1 check any device in aliveList time > 5min
			2 check inbox,
			3 check outbox
	if not master :
		while(true):
			1 check last master reply > 5min
			2 check last alive ping to master > 30s
			3 check inbox,
			4 check outbox

3. master : aliveList. ... contains device IP, Port, Unique Name, public key, timestamp of Joining, auto inc count(precidence for new master), last ping time
	update aliveList on every device ping,
	if device last ping time > 5min : remove from aliveList
	forward aliveList to all Device after update on device ping

4. new master resolution criteria : (when last response from master > 5min)
	lowest precidence count assumed master.
	if device precidence count is min:
		assume master role ... switch to master mode ... reduce all device precidence count by one and remove old master(s) (precidence count <0).
	else :
		reduce all device precidence count by one and remove old master(s) (precidence count <0) ... wait for 30s 
	still not resolved repeat.

5. entity authenticaion on new member added.
	1 new member forwards assosiation transaction 
	2 master verifies assosication transaction
	3 master forward group creation transaction
	4 new member verifies group creation transasction
	hence both authenticate each other.

6. when any device wants to send message
	1 get reciver info from latest aliveList.
	2 create message transaction.
	3 ping master message transaction.
	4 ping reciver with message transaction and assosication transaction.
	5 reciver verifies association transaction and recives message from transaction.
	6 ack with reciver association transaction.
	7 sender verifies reciver association transaction.
	
7. gui for master 
	1 can only run from master device.
	2 must show :
		a current aliveList *
		b all previous device archive
		c gas cost details per transaction *
		d interface to access any transaction 
		e audit trail *

--- remember while making contracts ---

1. maintain state as ENUM and function to checkState if state.idle == ContractState

2. super global variables .... 
	1 for transaction msg .... ex msg.sender (type : address)
	2 for blockchaain block .... ex block.timestamp (type : int)

3.	i. public functions can be called from any account
	ii. internal functions can only be called within public functions cannot be called from external
	iii. external functions can not be called by account that deployed the contract
